Matchmaking Process:

1. Client says either JOIN or CREATE

If JOIN:
	Client:
		while True:
			Client sends [JOIN, ROOM_NAME]
			Client receives confirmation
			If confirmed:
				boolean variable for confirmed
				exit loop
			Or if user wants to leave:
				Send leaving message
				exit loop
			Otherwise:
				Tell user to retry
		if confirmed:
			wait in a room function()
		Otherwise:
			close connection

	Server:
		Assume connection has already been forked to a thread
		while True:
			Receive Client data
			If room exists:
				Send confirmation to user
				FORMAT: [CONFIRMED_JOIN, room_name, other_players]
				exit loop
			Or if user is leaving:
				exit loop
			Otherwise:
				Send client a retry message
		if confirmed:
			activate server-side waiting function()
		close connection

Or CREATE:
	Client:
		while True:
			Client sends [CREATE, ROOM_NAME]
			Client receives confirmation
			If confirmed:
				boolean variable for confirmed
				exit loop
			Or if user wants to leave:
				Send leaving message
				exit loop
			Otherwise:
				Tell user room already exists
		if confirmed:
			wait in a room function()
		Otherwise:
			close connection

	Server:
		Assume connection has already been forked to a thread
		while True:
			Receive Client data
			If room doesnt exist:
				Send confirmation to user
				FORMAT: [CONFIRMED_CREATE, room_name, other_players]
				exit loop
			Or if user is leaving:
				exit loop
			Otherwise:
				Send client a retry message
		if confirmed:
			activate server-side waiting function()
		close connection
